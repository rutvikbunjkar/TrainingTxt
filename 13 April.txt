Agile : many waterfall models iterated

If data size is  small then we will use most understandable since most of the time it will be in maintainance sector 

Selection sort

Merge Sort
	use when array is tooo big
	
	splitting list
	splitting happens recursively
	one element arrays are formed
	then it compares two one element arrays and makes two element array by merging in sorted fashion
	then two two element arrays are to be merged 
	first compares two first elements and then the on which is smaller takes the first place in four element array 
	......

Quick sort



Search Algorithms


Scheduling problem

pseudocode
s
class for activity
array for activities
storing activities in array via for loop
sorting array with bubble sort 
for loop
	consider ith element 
	if that elements end is greater than later elements start AND previous elements end is smaller than this elements start then
	copy in arr1 


Binary Search


Linked List
 memory is allocated randomly, frangmented memory, not contiguous

When to use LL
-when we dont know how many entries are there
