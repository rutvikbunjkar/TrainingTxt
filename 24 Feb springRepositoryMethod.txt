spring if we want to not write any implementation then 


any java code that will talk to database then it is called dao or repository

this is how we do with repositories
make a new dao file 
also add required dependency


public interface CarPartsRepository extends CrudRepository<CarPart, Integer>{          //this is a dao file since it is speaking with 
	
	@Query("select c from CarPart c where c.car_model = ?1")  // like this we can also write our custom query if compiler is unable to write query for us due to bad naming convention 
	public Iterable<CarPart> findByCar_model(String model);  //here findByCarModel it should have been like this because we use the attribute name instead of column name
	                                                          //actually attribute name should have been carModel 
	                                                          //that ?1 is like placeholder so it will take value from first argument of method to which it is bind
	
}

above code is for getting all records with car_model spider
