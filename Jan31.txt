// wrapper class

for creating objects of primitive datatype
in some places like collections we do not use primitive
we are wrapping primitives
Wrapper classes are expensive if we cerate an object once and give value then we assign another value to it then first value will get wasted for garbage collector
different objects gets created everytime

wrapper classes are immutable


if double is used then it is primitive
if Double is used then it is wrapper class



-----------inner class

writing a class inside a class

-if there is some private variable which is needed for our second class then we write it inside a parent clss
-here we cans see multiple inheritance ie if outer class extends some class and inner class extends another class
so here this inner class is extending nearly 3 more classes
-we can make inside any class or function

// static inner class
// now we can create object of static inner class without creating object of outer class
//here if we want to use x in static class then we will have to create an object of outer class


-----------------ANNONYMOUS INNER CLASS-----------
-the class who doesnt have any name
-now if there is no name then how to make object of that class
-this will be always be extending some class 


-----------Assignment-------
1. read two numbers as an input from the user and ask user if he wants to sum or differnce and do as he says and give result
2. use inheritance and ovveri
