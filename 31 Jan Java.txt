- Anything is in static will be shown in itallics
-Exceptions in Java are Objects of respective class
-hierarchy
- java.lang.Exceptions is parent of all exceptions in java
-java.lang.
-Object 
	-Throwable
		-Error
			-Error and its subclasses are used for system level issues
			-for low level issues
			-e.g. OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError;

		-Exception
			-Exception and its subclasses are used for application level issues
			-for high level issues
			-e.g. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, NumberFormatException;
			-Two types of exceptions 
				-Checked : checked exceptions are derived from Exception Class
					-HAS TO BE HANDLED in the code
					-e.g. IOException, SQLException, ...
				-Unchecked : derived from RunTime Exception class;
					-OPTIONAL to Handle
					-e.g. NullPointerException, NumberFormatException, ... 


throws is type like thing ie if there is yhrows then we know what it will throw
use throw keyword to throw exception in catch e;

But we should use our user defined exceptions
like account exceptions and we have to create a class which extends Exception class or runtimeexception class
