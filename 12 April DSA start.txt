SDLC -> 1.finding requirement
        2.requirement analysis -> are they valid, are they feasible, are they functional requirement ex. which version to use, which color
        3.Analsis and design -> no. of users, database, 
        4.design -> on paper, specs of components, what to do, input, output
        5.development
        6.unit testing
        7.integration and testing
        8.bug fixing
        9.production
        10.maintenance

Main trade off 
 1.space vs time 
 2.whuch database to be use 

Agile 
1. important requirements are considered and done
2.quick dev and testing let's say 3 weeks -> this is called  sprint
3.more sprints

1.Sponsor requiremrnt is imp
2.user inputs are imp
3.systems req.

What is a good req 
atomic
uniquely identified
complete
testable

designing the program
inputs -> how much and from where
ui
data flow and output
logic

Problem Statement 1.input temp in fahrenheit 5/9 * f - 32 into celsius

writing pseudocode

prompt to input in f
var for f
input in fehrenheit 
operation
var for c 
print 
end

Problem Statement 2. swapping numbers and printing

pseudocode

prompt to input two values
print two variables
var to store two values
var to take values from those two variables
printing two variables
end

Problem Statement 3. input salaries and by some rules decide bonus

pseudocode

prompt to input salary
print input salary
perform operation
Output Bonus
end

Testing  -> two types functional  and non-functional
1.unit testing
2.integration testing
3.

Which data structure to be used can be decided by 

1.amount of data
2.How r we going to get data
3.how r we going to read it 
etc

Problem statement : input EMPLOYEE: id, name, basic salary, designation 
                    create an object
                    store this object in a array of 5 elements
                    display the list of all employees
		    ask if wants to delete an employee
                    add an employee add in middle or add in first or add in last
                      

pseudocode

Create a class with properties id,name,salary,designation
import the class in main method
prompt no. of employees want to insert
var for storing above int
definbe an array of above size
for loop starts for no. of employees like array.length
create an object of class
prompt Enter Employee id 
prompt Enter name
prompt Enter salary
prompt Enter designation
take inputs and save them in object parameters by calling set methods from object
add object in array
for loop ends
prompt if he wants to delete 
take input as yes or no
if string is yes then prompt to give id of employee to be deleted
Forloop for deleting
remove method on array to remove the employee with that id 
array element with id+1 his id becomes id-1
while(!i=array[i].getId)
with if st. if id is not equal index then array[i]= that object
