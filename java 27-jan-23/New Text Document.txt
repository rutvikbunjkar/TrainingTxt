// wrapper class

for creating objects of primitive datatype
in some places like collections we do not use primitive
we are wrapping primitives
Wrapper classes are expensive if we cerate an object once and give value then we assign another value to it then first value will get wasted for garbage collector
different objects gets created everytime

wrapper classes are immutable


if double is used then it is primitive
if Double is used then it is wrapper class



-----------inner class

writing a class inside a class

if there is some private variable which is needed for our second class then we write it inside a parent clss
here we cans see multiple inheritance ie if outer class extends some class and inner class extends another class
so here this inner class is extending nearly 3 more classes
