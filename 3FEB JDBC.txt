-We have an API as JDBC driver it can be seen as interface
-driver is medium to talk to the database, driver will take us to our destination
-mysql connector-> jdbc driver
-Class.forName("packagename.classname");



-closing connection is important it is done in finally block
-for DML we use statementobject.executUpdate("sql command"); //return type is int for rows affected
-for DQL we use stmt.executeQuery
-execute can be used but its return type is boolean true for select type and false for dml
- "?" is used as place holder


-when executing Select statement use stmt.executeQuery(query)


to close any variable or connection we do
try(load driver statement full)
catch{ exception for driver}
try(connection variable statement full)
