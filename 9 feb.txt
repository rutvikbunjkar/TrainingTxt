- Creating Objects of classes
	-there are different ways
	-Option1
------------------
if we have class like this
public class HelloWorld{

}

then in xml file, we need following entry
<bean id="hello" class="com.pratiti.component.HelloWorld"/>

Option 2
use of annotations

@Component("hello")
public class HelloWorld{

}

still we have to write this line in xml file
<context:component-scan base-package="package name"/>
	

	
-Managing dependencies between the objects
-we will have to do configuration for spring
choose official site

 <!-- this is we are telling spring to make an object of class helloworld and it will store it as hello in memory--> 
	<bean id = "hello" class="com.pratiti.component.HelloWorld" />
-spring will make only one object of our class 
-we have to use this when we want to make an object of library
this is called as singleton design pattern
-
-we want interface (interface is using loose coupling)
if an atm is taking data from all the banks then it is LOOSE COUPLING
so we want this

if spring will make objects at runtime then it is using loose coupling
-if we create object then it is tight coupling
