ORM - object relational mapping

not any reelation with above

This is Microservice

1.Persistence layer -(since here data will be there all the time or it will be persisted)this layer includes
-dao
-entity
-database

2.Business Logic layer
-Service classes - this contains business logic

3.Controller/Flow control logic
-outside client will talk to the controller through frontend/browser

conntroller will talk to business/service layer then this will talk to dao then dao will talk to db through entity

in microservices there are multiple api   

@Service  is same as @Component actually service is a type of component

actually repository , controller , service these are all components


in spring boot we do not need to make xml config file we will make settings in application propertiesfile

after running springbootdemoapplication we will go on postman

to talk in between client and server http protocol is no. 1

http has some methods as Get, Post, Put, Delete
Client will talk to server through front end and http protocol and this http protocol will communicate with controller

get method less data 2000 chars and data will be sent by appending with url

Post can transfer large amount of data from client to server
data here can be sent into body(this is like a envelope)
this means that everything in body gets stored in customer due to RequestBody
