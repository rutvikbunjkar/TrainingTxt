new modern mvc

here view is in angular or react 

controller is like rest api

model is service/dao/entity

to use spring

open start.spring.io
//use this tool or there will be difficulty in making project

do required changes and then in add dependencies then
add web, jpa, mysql driver, (optional) spring boot dev tools 

click on generate 
a zip file will be downloaded

in eclipse in file open projects from file
then on archive and select zip file then it will open it

then in src/main/java make another package for controller
make a controller file in it with @RestController as annotation on class
then @RequestMapping("/....")  modern way is like @GetMapping("/....")
actually in rest api methods should be specific so getMapping  ie request hasbeen sent from get method
browser request is more like get method
